## DroidconUK2016Hackathon

This is the project we developed for the Droidcon 2016 Hackathon. It's a lasertag game base on the TC8000 Scanner from Zebra and Firebase.

### Running the app
Import the project (root directory) into Android Studio, compile and run.

### Running the web interface
The web project is located in `web/bstf-manager`. It contains a full readme on how to run it.

### Setting up firebase
The firebase instance used during the hackathon has been disabled. You can create a new one at [the firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

Change the following files with the correct config: `app/google-services.json` and `web/btsf-manager/app/controllers/application.js`.
